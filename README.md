## About

The [3DGeo Research Group](https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/3dgeo/index_en.html) focuses on advancing geohazard monitoring through the use of 4D geospatial data. With global climate change accelerating environmental risks like landslides and rockfalls, our work leverages autonomous laser scanning (PLS) systems to capture real-time 3D data, enabling proactive risk management. We develop AI-driven methods for continuous hazard monitoring, bridging the gap between research and practical, application-oriented solutions. Our goal is to refine and extend multi-temporal analysis techniques to enhance hazard detection and mitigate the impact on communities and infrastructure. The study site is located in Trier, Germany.
